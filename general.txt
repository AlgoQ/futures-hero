Phase 1
Retrieve Data:
1. Retrieve data from BitSeven/Bybit for exchange
2. The trade data should be done within minutes, therefore minute data is mandatory (10 seconds interval)

User input:
1. User can choose platform to trade (BitSeven/Bybit)
2. User enter the API access token for the bot to help to trade.
3. User able to adjust leverage. (Default 50x)
4. User able to enter direction for entry position. (long/short)

Algorithm:
1. The default leverage is always 50x
2. The buy position is only 1 direction with the user's input.
	* The buy position is triggered
		- When the price on 1 min moves certain amount towards the trend within seconds timestamp
3. Close profit position for 15%
	* The profit will not be closed when there is no certain amount of price change against the direction within seconds-timestamp
4. Close losing position at 5-8% on 50x, again, depending on the leverage. 

Backtest Environment:
1. Retrieve chart data as usual
2. Using personal fake bitcoin number data to run the simulation to test the efficiency of the program.


Phase 2
1. Retrieve data from BitMEX for 4 hour / 6 hour trending so the script can run 24 hours
2. Alcm implemented as a choice for user, the alcm is always 50% of the initial position and user can input alcm number. 
3. The buy position is only 1 direction following the 4 hour or 6 hour trend.
4. War Formation detection is implemented for safe mode.
	* Mode added and can be selected by the user:
		- Quick mode (Phase 1 algorithm)
		- Safe mode (War Formation mode)
		- Alcm mode (Alcm mode) Stop loss immediately when direction changed
